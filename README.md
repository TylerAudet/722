# A pipeline for identifying variants of interest in a sexual size dimorphism reversed long term evolve and resequence study

## INTRODUCTION

Body size is a complex polygenic trait with important biological consequences. Physiologically, understanding the underlying genetics of body size variation is important because it influences a number of life-history traits, and provides insight into the evolutionary history of a species (Peters, 1989). Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is especially interesting because despite sharing much of the autosomal genome, males and females often vary in body size. This suggests that males and females have different optima for body size, and yet must use the same genetic architecture to achieve their own optimal size (Stewart & Rice, 2018). In the model organism D. melanogaster, females are 30% larger on average than males (Rideout et al., 2015). This is likely due to fecundity selection on females creating an optimally larger body size to maximize egg laying (Rideout et al., 2015). Sexually dimorphic body size has been examined in the lab by Rideout et al. (2015) and Millington et al. (2020;2021) and a number of genes of large effect have been identified. Many of these genes are in the insulin signaling pathway such as Drosophila insulin like peptide II (DILPII) and the transcription factor forkhead box O (FOXO) (Millington et al., 2020). The transformer (tra) gene in the sex differentiation pathway has also been shown to be an upstream influencer of sexual size dimorphism (Rideout et al., 2015). These genes have large effects, and were examined in laboratory bred strains, and have yet to be demonstrated in natural populations. Due to the large effect and biological necessity of these genes, they are presumably under stringent purifying selection, and variation in these genes does not seem like a likely explanation for the variability in body size within species.

Experimentally evolved populations combined with whole genome sequencing has created an opportunity to tease apart complex traits such as SSD. Artificially selecting on traits over multiple generations allows the examination of standing genetic variation and how it can respond to natural selection. Combined with this, methods derived for analyzing genomes sequenced from pools of individuals, termed pool-seq, has drastically reduced the cost of sequencing experimentally evolved populations. One such study looking at genomes from experimentally evolved D. melanogaster was conducted by Turner et al. (2011). Turner et al. (2011) selected on body size in D. melanogaster for 100 generations to create a lineage that is larger and a lineage that is smaller in average body size. They then looked for alleles under selection using a program called diffstat to identify peaks of differentiation across the genome. Body size in these lineages were incredibly polygenic, with peaks of selection spread out across the entire genome. The gene ontology for many of these peaks were in post-embryonic development and metamorphosis, and not in large impact genes in the insulin pathway (Turner et al., 2011). They inferred a high heritability for body size because of the rapid response to selection in the large and small selection lines, with a significant difference after 100 generations (Turner et al., 2011).

Parallel to this size concordant selection experiment, another lineage was selected for sex-discordant body size. This sex discordant lineage was selected for small females and large males to reverse the SSD present naturally in D. melanogaster (Stewart & Rice, 2018). Sexually discordant selective pressures create conflict in the genome as each sex diverges toward their optimum and away from the optimum of the other sex, termed intra-locus sexual conflict (Rice, 1992). SSD in particular has been shown to have a strong resistance to change when selected on in outbred populations (Reeve & Fairbairn, 1996; Tigreros & Lewis, 2011). Despite this, after 250 generations Stewart & Rice (2018) successfully reversed the SSD in D. melanogaster. This reversal was due predominantly to a decrease in female body size, and male body size was left unchanged. This is interesting because male body size changed in the lineages where body size was increased or decreased, which suggests a genetic correlation between the sexes may be impacting response (Stewart & Rice 2018). This is an exciting premise, because most traits responsible for sexual dimorphism are autosomal, and therefore this sex specific response may be indicative of an interesting genetic interaction at sexually antagonistic loci (Fairbarn & Roff, 2006). 

Stewart & Rice (2018) conclude that SSD is a highly persistent trait. They then hypothesise that genes responsible for this phenotypic conservation would be extremely polygenic and located far upstream of body size determining loci (Stewart & Rice, 2018). The genomic consequences of this SSD reversal have yet to be examined, and a comparison to the large and small selection lineages have also not been conducted. With this pipeline I plan on identifying SNPs that are present in this sexual size reversal lineage of flies. This will lay the foundation to follow up on Turner et al., (2011) after 378 generations of experimental evolution. This work also allows an examination of the genes responsible for the conservation of SSD in D. melanogaster. I hypothesize that genes under selection in the SSD reversal lineage will be upstream of the genes found by Turner et al. (2011), and that possibly the same alleles may be present in the sex reversal population as the large and small populations. In this examination I plan on establishing a pipeline that can be used to clean and map the genomes and identify SNPs that are under selection. I also plan on looking at Fst as a measure of heterozygosity in the reversal selection lineage to identify locations across the genomes that are under selection to further verify the loci of interest for further analysis.

### MD5 check ###

My samples were downloaded from the Genome Quebec website using curl on to the McMaster cluster. To ensure they were uploaded without issue I run an MD5 check using the command below. All files print out that they are downloaded 'OK', so I can continue.

````
md5sum -c readSets.md5
````

### Quality check ###

To check te quality of my samples I run `fastqc *.fastq` on them. This will report the number of reads, the proportion of duplication, adapter contamination, and repetetive sequences. I can then run `multiqc .` to compile all the outputs of fastqc to a single summary sheet. The output looks like this:

Screen Shot 2021-04-01 at 8.56.08 AM![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77504755/113297298-6fb24280-92c8-11eb-94b2-df4574fb5dfe.png)

As expected there is substantial adapter contamination:

Screen Shot 2021-04-01 at 8.59.53 AM![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77504755/113297492-af792a00-92c8-11eb-93e6-3b6d01d3777a.png)

### Trimmomatic ###

To remove this adapter contamination I use Trimmomatic with the following code:

````
#!/bin/bash

# make variable for trimmomatic program location
trim=/usr/local/trimmomatic/trimmomatic-0.36.jar

# make input directory for raw reads
raw_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/genomes

# make output directory from trimmomatic outputs
trim_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/trimmed

# make path to adapter sequences (to be used with ILLUMINACLIP)
adapter=/home/tylera/scripts/AllAdapters.fa

#list all files to be read (all raw data)
files=(${raw_dir}/*_R1.fastq.gz)

#For loop over every file
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _R1.fastq.gz`

java -jar ${trim} PE -threads 16 -phred33 \
  -trimlog ${trim_dir}/trimlog.txt \
  ${raw_dir}/${base}_R1.fastq.gz \
  ${raw_dir}/${base}_R2.fastq.gz \
  ${trim_dir}/${base}_R1_PE.fastq.gz \
  ${trim_dir}/${base}_R1_SE.fastq.gz \
  ${trim_dir}/${base}_R2_PE.fastq.gz \
  ${trim_dir}/${base}_R2_SE.fastq.gz \
  ILLUMINACLIP:${adapter}:2:30:10:2 \ #ILLUMINACLIP:${adapter}:2:30:10:2 Gives the window to search for adapters and the location of my adapter file
  LEADING:5 \ #This tells Trimmomatic to cut off the first and last 5 basepares if they fall below my quality threshold
  TRAILING:5 \ #Same as above
  MAXINFO:35:0.5 \ #MAXINFO:35:0.5 This is the balance between the minimum length I want a read to be and the error rate
  MINLEN:36 \ #This is the minimum length of a read that will be kept
  AVGQUAL:20 #This is the minimum quality to be kept
  
done
````

After this I run the outputs through `fastqc` and `multiqc` again. The adapter contamination has been removed, however there are still a number of 6mer repetitive sequences. I also notice that the aximum sequence length is 151. Although my sequences were supposed to be 150bp in length, Genome Quebec sendan extra basepair on each read. This extra basepar could be a part of the problem.

I decided to try two other trimming programs to see if any will result in no 6mer repetitive sequences. I choose bbduk and trim galore because they are the two I have seen in the literature other than Trimmomatic.

### Trim_galore ###

Trim Galore is a wrapper for cutadapt. Cutadapt trims adapters but dies not quality trim, trim_galore integrates fastqc to trim for quality as well. After a first pass, there is still 151 basepairs for some reads, and 6mer contamination in all reads. So the script below was used to first run it through to hard trim to 150bp, and then screen for adapters and quality. The output still had 6mer contamination and lower quality than Trimmomatic, which makes it an unideal fit for this pipeline.

````
#!/bin/bash

# make variable for trim_galore program location
trim=/home/tylera/bin/TrimGalore-0.6.6/trim_galore

# make input directory for raw reads
raw_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/genomes

# make output directory from trimmomatic outputs
trim_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/trim_galore

#list all files to be read (all raw data)
files=(${raw_dir}/*_R1.fastq.gz)

#For loop over every file
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _R1.fastq.gz`

${trim} --hardtrim5 150 --paired --cores 4 --retain_unpaired \
${raw_dir}/${base}_R1.fastq.gz ${raw_dir}/${base}_R2.fastq.gz \
--o /2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/trim_galore
  
done


# make variable for trimmomatic program location
trim=/home/tylera/bin/TrimGalore-0.6.6/trim_galore

# make output directory from trimmomatic outputs
trim_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/trim_galore

files=(${trim_dir}/150/*150bp_5prime.fq)

#For loop over every file
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _R1.150bp_5prime.fq`

#fastqc flag signals that we want to quality trim the reads as well

${trim} --paired --fastqc --cores 4 --retain_unpaired --gzip \
${trim_dir}/150/${base}_R1.150bp_5prime.fq ${trim_dir}/150/${base}_R2.150bp_5prime.fq \
--o /2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/trim_galore
  
done
````

### bbduk ###

Next I tried bbduk. This program is meant for quality as well as adapter trimming. It also has alot of options to customize exactly how you want to trim sequences, so it can be very adaptable. 

````
#!/bin/bash

# make variable for trimmomatic program location
#trim=/home/tylera/bin/TrimGalore-0.6.6/trim_galore

# make input directory for raw reads
raw_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/genomes

# make output directory from trimmomatic outputs
trim_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bbduk

#list all files to be read (all raw data)
files=(${raw_dir}/*_R1.fastq.gz)

#For loop over every file
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _R1.fastq.gz`

/usr/local/BBmap/bbduk.sh \ #Path to bbduk
in1=${raw_dir}/${base}_R1.fastq.gz \
in2=${raw_dir}/${base}_R2.fastq.gz \
out1=${trim_dir}/${base}_R1_trimmed.fastq.gz \
out2=${trim_dir}/${base}_R2_trimmed.fastq.gz \
ref=/home/tylera/scripts/AllAdapters.fa \ #Path to reference adapters
threads=8 ftr=149 ktrim=r k=23 mink=6 hdist=1 tpe tbo \
qtrim=rl trimq=20 minlength=36 2> /2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bbduk/log/${base}.log

#ftr=149: the basepair to trim after (anchored at 0) so 149 will trim off the 151st bp
#ktrim=r: This flag tells bbduk that once it finds and adapter to trim everything to the right (r) of it
#k=23: This is the expected length of my adapter
#mink=6: This is the smallest possible length of an adapter to trim
#hdist=1: This allows one mismatch in a trimmed region
#tpe: This tells bbduk to trim both reads to the same length if an adapter is found on one pair
#tbo: This trims based on paired overlap detection
#qtrim=rl: Adapters are expected on the right side of reads
#trimq=20: Trim anything qith quality less than 20
#2> : save the log to this folder
  
done
````

BBduk removed far more 6mers and also removed the extra asepair present with the other two trimmers. Quality appears to be high, and although there is still a small amount of 6mer contamination, they do not match any adapter sequences so they may be contamination from yeast or bacteria which are common in fly samples. BBduk also did not removed much more than the other two, which hopefully means I did not accidentally over-trim my reads.



### BWA mem ###

In order to map my reads I download the Drosophila reference genome from flybase using 'curl'
````
curl -O ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r6.23_FB2018_04/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.23.fasta.gz
````
I then need to index it so that BWA knows how to read it.

````
bwa index dmel-all-chromosome-r6.23.fasta.gz
````

Once I have an indexed reference genome I can map my reads to it using 'BWA mem' Using the following script.


````
#!/bin/bash

# directory of processed sequences with trimmomatic
trim_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bbduk

# variable for the reference genome
refGenome=/2/scratch/TylerA/Dmelgenome/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.23.fasta.gz

# make output directory from mapping outputs
output=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/sam_files

# make BWA directory path
bwa_dir=/usr/local/bwa/0.7.8

cd ${bwa_dir}

#list all files to be read (this selects the left end from each PE pair)
files=(${trim_dir}/*_R1_trimmed_good.fastq.gz)

#For loop over every file
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _R1_trimmed_good.fastq.gz`

bwa mem -t 16 -M ${refGenome} \
${trim_dir}/${base}_R1_trimmed_good.fastq.gz \
${trim_dir}/${base}_R2_trimmed_good.fastq.gz \
> ${output}/${base}_bwa_PE.SAM
done

# -M Mark shorter split hits as secondary (for Picard compatibility).
# -t used to tell BWA to use 16 threads
````


### Sam to Bam ###

I next converted the SAM files outputted from the mapping to BAM files. SAM files are very large, and take up too much space on the cluster, so keeping them in their binary format is less memory intensive. The following script is written to just take any SAM files in the current directory and convert them to BAM. I can then use `rm *SAM` to get rid of the huge SAM files.

During this step I also sort the reads in the samples. This will be necessary in downstream filtering and other steps.

````
#!/bin/bash

#Specify input directory
sam_dir=.

#Specify output directory
bam_dir=.

files=(${sam_dir}/*.SAM)

for file in ${files[@]} 
do 
name=${file} base=`basename ${name} .SAM`

samtools view -b -@8 ${sam_dir}/${base}.SAM | samtools sort -o ${bam_dir}/${base}.bam 
done 

# -b output to bam
# @8 use 8 threads
````

### Merge files ###

My initial samples did not meet the read depth that we paid for, so Genome Quebec re-ran any samples that were less than 105M reads. At this stage I need to merge the samples from the two different runs in to matching files. I use the following script:

````
#!/bin/bash

run1=run1
run2=run2

bam_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap
merged_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/merged

files=(${bam_dir}/${run1}/*_bwa_PE.bam)

for file in ${files[@]} 
do 
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _bwa_PE.bam`
samtools merge ${merged_dir}/${base}_merged_aligned_PE.bam \
${bam_dir}/${run1}/${base}_bwa_PE.bam \
${bam_dir}/${run2}/${base}_bwa_PE.bam

done 
````

For this to run I create a run1/ and run2/ directory and sort my reads in to them using `mv`. I then need to move the samples that did not need an extra run in to my merged/ folder, because they can cause issues with this script if they do not have a matching pair in the run2/ file. After the files have been merged I can delete my run1/ and run2/ directories.

### Quality filter ###

Next I need to filter for quality because accuracy is very important for SNP calling, as low quaslity can result in false positives. To do this I can use `samtools view` to filter out reads below a certain quality score. I Did this code twice, one with a conservative quality of 20, and again with a more stringent quality of 30. I compared the coverage between the two and found that a more stringent quality score removed more reads without impacting the coverage, so I decided to go with a quality filter of 30.

````
#for all files

#!/bin/bash
#
#Specify output directory
out_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/filter30

#temp storage 
in_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/merged

files=(${in_dir}/*_merged_aligned_PE.bam)

for file in ${files[@]} 
do 
name=${file} 
base=`basename ${name} _merged_aligned_PE.bam`
samtools view -b -q 30 -@ 16 \
${in_dir}/${base}_merged_aligned_PE.bam \
> ${out_dir}/${base}.bam
done 
#-b indicates bam files being used
#-q 30 indicates quality threshold
#-@ 16 indicates threads being used
````

### Calculate coverage ###

Next I calculate the coverage of the samples after filtering for each quality threshold using `samtools depth`.

````
#!/bin/bash

in_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/filter30

files=(${in_dir}/*.bam)

for file in ${files[@]} 
do 
name=${file} 
base=`basename ${name} .bam`
samtools depth ${in_dir}/${base}.bam > ${in_dir}/${base}.coverage
done
````

The output .coverage file can be visualized with a histogram using the scripts below.

````
#!/bin/bash

in_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/filter30

files=(${in_dir}/*.bam)

for file in ${files[@]} 
do 
name=${file} 
base=`basename ${name} _merged_aligned_PE.bam`
Rscript /2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/scripts/depth_histogram.R ${in_dir}/${base}.coverage ${base}
done 
````


````
##coverage_histogram.R
## need next line to call arguments:
args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

#read in the first argument which should be the file
dat <- read.table(args[1])
#the title should be the second argument (the base name)
title <- args[2]
colnames(dat) <- c("chr","pos","depth")

#make a histogram of the coverage for each file
pdf(paste(title, ".pdf", sep=""))
hist(dat$depth, xlim=c(0,500), breaks=500)
dev.off()
````
### Quality threshold of 20 ###
C1F_20.pdf![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77504755/113307003-abeaa080-92d2-11eb-9f77-48da9dea49b7.png)

### Quality thresholf of 30 ###

C1F_30.pdf![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77504755/113307082-c1f86100-92d2-11eb-9aca-cd725e8ecf2f.png)

Coverage was not noticeably reduced by a more stringent filter, so in the interest of calling the fewest false SNPs as possible I filter all samples for quality 30. We expected around 200x coverage using the formula coverage = # of reads * length of reads / length of the genome. My coverage histogram shows coverage over 200x though, which means there could be duplicated reads from PCR optical duplication.

### Deduplicating the bam files ###

Because there seem to be erroneous duplication, next I need to remove these optical duplicates. This is done most commonly with Picard. I used the following script:

````
#! /bin/bash

mapped_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/filter30
outdir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/dedup
picdir=/usr/local/picard-tools/picard.jar

files=(${mapped_dir}/*.bam)

for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} .bam`
#echo ${name}
java -Xmx2g -jar \
${picdir} MarkDuplicates \
I=${mapped_dir}/${base}.bam \
O=${outdir}/${base}_rmd.bam \
M=${outdir}/dupstat.txt \
VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=SILENT \
REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true
done
````

Afterwards my coverage looks like this:

***S2F.pdf![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77504755/113308302-07695e00-92d4-11eb-838f-c6b4c95d68d4.png)

There still appears to be reads over 200x, but fewer. This step also reduced coverage by quite a bit, with far ewer reads close to the 200x mark.

### Adding in read groups ###

My next step is to realign around indels. To do this I need read-groups added to my bam files. These can be added using Picard.

````
#! /bin/bash

#Variable for project:
project_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/dedup

#Path to Picard
picdir=/usr/local/picard-tools/picard.jar


files=(${project_dir}/*.bam)
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} .bam`

java -jar ${picdir} AddOrReplaceReadGroups I=${project_dir}/${base}.bam \
  O=${project_dir}/${base}_RG.bam \
  RGID=1_2 \
  RGLB=library1 \
  RGPL=illumina \
  RGPU=None \
  RGSM=${base}

done
````

## Index for GATK ##

Indel realignment is done using GATK. This is a three step process. With the first script I index all files for GATK so they can be read properly. In the next script, indels are identified and marked. And finally in the third script, the indels are filtered out.

````
#! /bin/bash 

# Index files

#Variable to put indexed files in 
index_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/gatk/index

#Path to input directory

files=(${input}/*_rmd_RG.bam)
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _rmd_RG.bam`

samtools index ${input}/${base}_rmd_RG.bam 

done
````
The reference also needs to be indexed for the next steps.

````
samtools faidx dmel-all-chromosome-r6.23.fasta.gz
````

````

  -o ${gatk_dir}/${base}_realigned.bam

done
````

### pileups and mpileups ###

A single mpileup will be needed with my sample information for SNP calling and population statistics, and a pileup file will be needed for each sample for the pi statistic calculation. I can create mpileups using `samtools mpileup`. First I can make a pileup for each sample by running the following script. I've already filtered for quality multipe times, so I have disabled the quality filtering because it is redundant.

````
#! /bin/bash

mapped_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/gatk
picdir=/usr/local/picard-tools/picard.jar
genome=/2/scratch/TylerA/Dmelgenome/gatk/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.23.fa
out_dir=/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/pile

files=(${mapped_dir}/*_realigned.bam)
for file in ${files[@]}
do
name=${file}
base=`basename ${name} _realigned.bam`
samtools mpileup -B -Q 0 -f ${genome} ${mapped_dir}/${base}_realigned.bam \
> ${out_dir}/${base}.pileup
done

#-B: disables base alignment quality calculations to speed up the process
#-Q 0: Disables base quality filtering
#-f: tells samtools that the files are indexed as fasta files
````

I next create my mpileup for all my samples:

````
samtools mpileup -B -Q 20 -f \
/2/scratch/TylerA/Dmelgenome/gatk/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.23.fa \
/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/gatk/*_realigned.bam \
> samples.mpileup
````
These mpileups need to have the indels and repeteive regions masked because these are regions where SNP false discovery is common. This can be done with popoolation commands.

````
# Create a GTF

````

And I also create sync files for population statistic calculations:

````
java -ea -jar /usr/local/popoolation/mpileup2sync.jar --threads 16 --input sample_indels_repetetive.mpileup --output sample_indels_repetetive.sync

## Popoolation Statistics ##

### Fst for our Experimental population ###

Next, I want to calculate the Fst statistic for my experimental population compared to my control populations to look at structure.

````
perl /home/tylera/bin/popoolation2_1201/fst-sliding.pl \
				--input /2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/Experimental/sample_indels_repetetive.sync \
				--output /2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/popoolation/single_SNP.fst \
				--min-count 2 \
				--min-coverage 10 \
				--max-coverage 300 \
				--min-covered-fraction 1 \
				--window-size 1 \
				--step-size 1 \
				--pool-size 100
````

The resulting Fst file can be visualized in R: 

````
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

## SNP calling ##

SNPs can be indentified using varscan and the following code:

````
java -Xmx32g -jar \
~/bin/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar \
mpileup2cns \
/2/scratch/TylerA/SSD/bwamap/Experimental/sample_indels_repetetive.mpileup \
--min-coverage 50 \
--min-reads2 2 \
--p-value 1e-5 \
--strand-filter 1 \
--min-var-freq 0.1 \
--min-freq-for-hom 0.98 \
--min-avg-qual 20 \
--variants \
--output-vcf 1 \
| bgzip > sub.vcf.gz
````

Using this code varscan identified 327734 SNPs.
